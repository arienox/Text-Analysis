# Text-Analysis
The code provided is a Python script that performs various text processing tasks on a set of URLs. The script reads an Excel file containing a list of URLs and their associated IDs, and then visits each URL using a web driver. It extracts the article text from each URL using BeautifulSoup, and saves the text to a text file named after the URL ID. The script then creates a directory for these text files and moves them to this directory.

The script then loads several stop word files and NLTK stop words, and combines them to create a set of stop words. It reads in two files containing positive and negative words, respectively, and adds the words to a dictionary, excluding those that appear in the stop word set. The script also defines a function to count syllables in a given text.

Next, the script processes each text file in the directory created earlier. It tokenizes the text and removes stop words and punctuation, counts personal pronouns, calculates the polarity and subjectivity scores based on the positive and negative words dictionary, counts the number of sentences, calculates the average number of words per sentence, calculates the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and stores these results in a list. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a readability score that indicates the minimum education level required to understand a given text.

Overall, the script provides a framework for automated text processing and analysis on a set of URLs. It could be used for tasks such as content analysis, sentiment analysis, or readability analysis. However, it is important to note that the script has limitations and assumptions, such as relying on the accuracy of the web driver to extract article text, and the quality and completeness of the stop word set and positive/negative words dictionary. Additionally, the script may require customization or modification for different text processing needs or languages.
